XML Parser
==========

ucw-xml/xml.h
-------------

To parse a document, create a parser context (<<struct_xml_context,struct xml_context>>),
initialize it with <<xml_init()>>, fill in requested parsing mode, pointers to hooks, and
other parameters. Then call <<xml_parse()>> or <<xml_next()>> as you need. At the end, dispose
of the context by <<xml_cleanup()>> or recycle it by <<xml_reset()>>.
