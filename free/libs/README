This package contains all libraries from the freely distributable version
of the Sherlock Holmes search engine (see http://www.ucw.cz/holmes/).

See doc/using-libs for description of the libraries.

See doc/install for build requirements (the rest of the document does not apply).

Use `./configure && make' to build the libraries.

See doc/configure if you want to tweak what gets built (for example, you can
call `./configure -CONFIG_SHARED' to build the libraries statically or
call `./configure -CONFIG_IMAGES' to avoid building the image library).
