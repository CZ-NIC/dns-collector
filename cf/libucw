# Configuration of the UCW library and related utilities (included by cf/sherlock)

######## Memory Mapped Access to Files ##########################################

# Whenever you specify 0 for I/O buffer size, memory mapping is used instead.
FBMMap {

# Map this many bytes at once (needs to be a multiple of CPU page size)
WindowSize		1M

# When in need to extend a file, grow it by so many bytes (>= page size)
ExtendSize		1M

}

######## Direct Streamed I/O on Files ###########################################

FBDirect {

# Debug: Cheat by turning off O_DIRECT
#Cheat			1

}

######## Atomic Multi-Threaded I/O on Files #####################################

FBAtomic {

# Enable tracing
#Trace			1

}

######## Parametrized I/O on Files ##############################################

FBParam {

Defaults {

# Access type (std|direct|mmap).
Type			std

# Size of I/O buffer. Something of the order of megabytes for fast disks is recommended for direct I/O.
BufSize			64K

# Optimize for mixed forward/backward reading (standard I/O only)
KeepBackBuf		0

# Perform read-ahead (direct I/O only)
ReadAhead		1

# Maximum number of write-back requests queued (direct I/O only)
WriteBack		1

}

}

######## Temporary files ########################################################

Tempfiles {

# By default, we use the system's default temporary directory ($TMPDIR or /tmp),
# but sometimes it is better to store the temporary files in the local tree.
Dir			tmp

# Prefix of temporary file names
Prefix			temp-

# By default, we append a random number to Prefix to get a temporary file name.
# If Prefix points to a directory that is not writable by malicious users,
# we can be less careful and use more consistent names of temporary files
# formed by adding "pid(-tid)-counter" instead.
PublicDir		0

}

######## Threads ################################################################

Threads {

# Default thread stack size
DefaultStackSize	64K

}

######## Sorter #################################################################

Sorter {

# Trace sorting (1=basic statistics, 2=more stats, 3 and more for debugging)
Trace			2

# Trace array sorting (internal sorters)
TraceArray		0

# How much memory is the sorter allowed to use
SortBuffer		4M

# File access used by the sorter (see FBParam section for details)
FileAccess		std 256K

# Use a different file access method for small inputs (less than the specified size)
SmallFileAccess		std 64K
SmallInput		64M

# Min-/Maximum number of bits to use in the external radix-sort (beware, we will open
# 1+2^this files and require a stream buffer for each of them; however, while we are
# doing that, the sort buffer is not allocated). Set both to zero to disable radix-sorting.
MinRadixBits		2
MaxRadixBits		4

# The same for multi-way merging. The memory requirements are also the same,
# but please keep in mind that this can create lots of SortBuffer-sized files,
# so it is probably better to keep it disabled if you have a small SortBuffer.
MinMultiwayBits		2
MaxMultiwayBits		4

# If we did not use radix-sorter to the full width, we still might add some more
# bits to the width to get chunks which are even smaller than SortBuffer, because
# it can speed up internal sorting later. However, we also want to avoid small
# files, so we add only a little.
AddRadixBits		2

# Number of threads used for sorting (0=disable threading)
Threads			0

# Minimum size of input (in bytes) to consider multi-threaded internal sorting
ThreadThreshold		1M

# Chunks smaller than ThreadThreshold are sorted by a sequential algorithm, but
# if they are at least of the following size, different chunks are sorted in
# parallel. There is a slight space penalty for setting up the parallel process,
# so better avoid setting this number too small.
ThreadChunk		256

# Internal radix-sort stops at this size and switches to QuickSort (must be >0)
RadixThreshold		4K

# Debugging switches (see the source)
Debug			0

######## URL processing #########################################################

URL {

# Ignore spaces at the start/end of a URL
IgnoreSpaces		1

# Ignore underflows in relative paths (/../ from root)
IgnoreUnderflow		1

# Some URL's with many repeated components are filtered out to avoid infinite
# URL's (e.g. http://czech.recoder.cz/win/iso/win/iso/file.html, or
# http://a.com/?a=b&a=b&a=b, ...).
# The URL is split to components divided by any of the specified separators.
# Then the separators are forgotten and the components between them are
# examined.
ComponentSeparators	/&?

# URL is filtered out if there's a sequence of components in a row with at most
# MaxRepeatLength components and the sequence is repeated more than MinRepeatCount
# times.  Default values are high MinRepeatCount and low MaxRepeatLength, so the
# mechanism is disabled.
MinRepeatCount		4
MaxRepeatLength		4

# Maximum number of occurences of a single component in the entire URL (possibly interleaved
# by different components). The detector is disabled by default.
MaxOccurences		4
