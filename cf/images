######## Image signatures #######################################################

ImageSig {

# To find similar images, Sherlock uses comparison based on regions.
# First of all, the imagesim analyser extracts various region features.
# Sets of these features are called "image signatures" and they are stored
# in the `H' attribute of image objects.

# Signatures are later processed by the indexer to build an effective
# search structure finally used by the search server. See Indexer and Search
# sections for more options.

# Minimum image size to apply segmentation. Smaller images are always
# compared by the simple "average" method (see ImageSig.CompareMethod).
MinWidth		16
MinHeight		16

# List of subdivision thresholds in the first phase of segmentation.
# Lower the values to increase the average number of regions and vice versa.
PreQuantThresholds	6 12 15 20 25 25 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 60

# Settings for the second phase of segmentation -- usually not so important.
# We use an iterative algorithm to improve the average error from the first phase.
# We stop the process after PostQuantMaxSteps or if we get only PostQuantThreshold
# percentual improvement over the previous step.
PostQuantMinSteps	2
PostQuantMaxSteps	10
PostQuantThreshold	1

# BorderBonus and BorderSize parameters can increase or decrease the weight
# of image pixels near the borders. Weight of all pixels more than BorderSize * MIN(cols, rows)
# pixels far from the edges is 128. Then this value continuously decreses/increses up to 128+BorderSize.
BorderSize		0.4
BorderBonus		-50

# Scaling constants for computation of normalized i-th order inertia features (I1, I2, I3).
InertiaScale		2 0.5 0.05

# Threshold for detecting textured images (see images/sig-txt.c for details).
# Decrease the threshold if you want less detected textures,
# set it to zero to disable the algorithm completely.
