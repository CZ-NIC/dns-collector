######## Image signatures #######################################################

ImageSig {

# Sherlock use regions based image comparision to find similar images.
# First of all imagesim analyser extracts various regions features
#  needed for comparisions. Sets of these features are called 
# "image signatures" and they are stored in attributes 'H'.

# Signatures are later processed by chewer to build an effective
# search structure finally used by search server. See Indexer and Search
# sections for more options.


# Minimum image size to apply segmentation. Smaller images are always
# compared with simple "average" method (see ImageSig.CompareMethod).
MinWidth	16
MinHeight	16

# List of subdivision thresholds in first phase of segmentation.
# Lower the values to increase average number of regions and vice versa.
PreQuantThresholds	6 12 15 20 25 25 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 60

# Settings for second phase of segmentation - usually not so important.
# We use iterative algorithm to improve average error from the first phase.
# We stop the process after PostQuantMaxSteps or if we get only PostQuantThreshold
# percentual improvement in comparision with the previous step.
PostQuantMinSteps	2
PostQuantMaxSteps	10
PostQuantThreshold	1

# BorderBonus and BorderSize parameters can increase or decrease the weight
# of image pixels near the borders. Weight of all pixels more than BorderSize * MIN(cols, rows)
# pixels far from the edges is 128. Then this value continuously decrese/increse up to 128+BorderSize.
BorderSize		0.4
BorderBonus		-50

# Scaling constants for computation of normalized i-th order inertia features (I1, I2, I3).
InertiaScale		2 0.5 0.05

# Threshold for detecting textured images (see images/sig-txt.c for details).
# Decrease the threshold if you want less detected textures,
# set it to zero to disable the algorithm completely.
TexturedThreshold	0.32
