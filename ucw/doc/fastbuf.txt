Fastbufs
========

A *fastbuf* is a stream (or file) abstraction optimized for both speed
and flexibility.

Fastbufs can represent many different kinds of objects: regular files, network
sockets, file descriptors in general, or various memory buffers. These objects
are handled by different fastbuf *back-ends.*

Once you have a fastbuf, you can access it by fuctions similar to those of
`stdio.h`, or you can use a variety of fastbuf *front-ends* providing various
formatted operations.

Please keep in mind that fastbufs do not allow arbitrary mixing of reads and
writes on the same stream. If you need to mix them, you have to call bflush()
inbetween and remember that the file position reported by btell() points after
the flushed buffer, which is not necessarily the same as after the data you've
really read.
