UCW-TABLEPRINTER(1)
===================

NAME
----

ucw-tableprinter - UCW table printer is a program module that allows user-customized printing of tables.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The table printer module provides formatting of 2-dimensional tables
in various ways.

Each table print-out consists of a number of rows, which are processed
one after another. All rows have the same number of columns. Once a
table is defined, it can be printed using a variety of formatters
(block-line, human-readable, machine-readable, etc.).

The table definition consists of various column definitions, each
column definition is a pair consisting of a name and a type. Name of
each column must be unique in the whole table. Each column definition
can be instantiated(printed) in its own format, e.g., a size column
can be printed three-times: 1) in bytes; 2) in gigabytes; 3)
human-readable.

The table can be controlled using various options:

[options="header"]
|===============================================================================================================
| option      | argument                    | meaning
| `header`    | 0 or 1                      | set whether a table header should be printed
| `noheader`  | 'none'                      | equivalent to `header`=0
| `cols`      | comma-separated column list | set order of columns
| `fmt`	      | `human`/`machine`/`block`   | set table formatter to one of the built-in formatters
| `col-delim` | string                      | set column delimiter
| `cells`     | string                      | set column cell format mode, possibilities are: default, raw, pretty
| `raw`	      | 'none'                      | set column cell format to raw data, equivalent to cells:raw
| `pretty`    | 'none'                      | set column cell format to pretty-printing, equivalent to cells:pretty
|===============================================================================================================

Column order (`cols` option) has the following format:

<col-order-string> := <col-def>[,<col-def>]*

<col-def> := <col-name> [ '[' <col-opts> ']' ]

<col-name> is a string that does not contain comma ',' or '[',']' brackets

<col-opts> := <string> [ ',' <string> ]

Where <col-opts> is a comma-separated list of options.

Column delimiter option (`col-delim`) can be an arbitrary string. The
cell format option `cells` can have one of the possible three values:
1) `pretty`, 2) `default`, 3) `raw`. The `raw` and `pretty` value of
`cells` option can be shortcutted as options `raw` and `pretty` with
no value.

Additionally to standart types (like integer, floating point) there
are the two following types: 1) size; 2) timestamp. The 'size' type
has the following case-sensitive column options: `KB`, `MB`, `GB`,
`TB`, `auto`, e.g., a column of type size and name `file-size` can be
specified as `file-size[MB]` or `file-size[auto]`.  The 'timestamp'
has the following case-sensitive column options: 1) `datetime` which
corresponds to date(1) format "%F %T", 2) `timestamp` which
corresponds to a number of seconds relative to start of some epoch.

Description of table formats
-----------------------------

'human-readable': prints columns separated by single space, rows
separated by newline '\n'.

'block-line': prints each column on one line, i.e., the column
separator is '\n', rows are separated by double newlines
'\n\n'. Therefore, rows forms newline separated blocks of rows.

'machine-readable': prints columns separated by a tabulator '\t', rows
separated by '\n'.
