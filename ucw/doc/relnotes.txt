Release notes
=============

5.0 (work in progress)
----------------------

* The <<mainloop:,mainloop>> module has been rewritten:
** Multiple instances of the main loop are supported (to be used in different
   threads or locally within a library function).
** The new implementation is more efficient: it uses heaps for timers,
   epoll() for file descriptors (when available).
** The return value of <<mainloop:struct_main_file,`main_file`>> handlers has been
   changed to <<mainloop:enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>> and <<mainloop:enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>.
   However, the numerical values are equal, so old code should keep working.
** *Incompatible:* The global variables `main_now`, `main_now_seconds`,
   and `main_idle_time` are no longer available. They have become fields
   in the `main_context` structure, which can be accessed either directly
   or via helper functions like <<mainloop:fun_main_get_now,`main_get_now()`>>.
** *Incompatible:* The interface for asynchronous reading and writing
   (file_read() and friends) has been separated from the core of the main loop.
   Use <<mainloop:struct_main_block_io,`struct main_block_io`>> and related functions instead.
** *Incompatible:* file_close_all() is gone. You have to call <<mainloop:fun_main_teardown,`main_teardown()`>>
   or <<mainloop:fun_main_destroy,`main_destroy()`>> to clean up properly after fork().
** Added support for <<mainloop:signal,synchronous delivery of signals>>.
** Added relative timers: <<mainloop:fun_timer_add_rel,`timer_add_rel()`>>.
** Modification of events from a running event handler is always safe.
** Deleting an already deleted event is always safe.
** For any event type, it is possible to ask whether it is active (added to the mainloop) or not: <<mainloop:fun_hook_is_active,`hook_is_active()`>> and friends.
** A new mainloop front-end for asynchronous <<mainloop:recordio,record-based I/O>> has been added.

* Added support for <<trans:,resource pools and transactions>>, which is a general
  mechanism for tracking resources and reporting errors. It is still considered
  experimental, so the API can change in future releases.

* Added a growing array module `gary.h`, similar to `gbuf.h`, but with
  a much more convenient interface.

* The <<lists:,Circular linked lists>> can recognize unlinked nodes,
  see <<lists:fun_clist_unlink,`clist_unlink()`>>.

* Added `strtonum.h` -- a module for precise parsing of numbers.

* When compiled by a recent enough GCC, `__thread` is used for thread-local variables,
  which is more efficient than the POSIX per-thread storage.
** *Incompatible:* `ucwlib_context->thread_id` is no longer available directly,
  please use ucwlib_thread_id() instead.

* *Incompatible:* Several modules have been declared obsolete and removed:
** `sighandler` -- generic signal handling (it still exists internally)
** `qache` -- a mmap-based shared cache
** `prefetch` -- an interface to memory prefetch instructions; superseded by GCC `__builtin_prefetch`
** `randomkey` -- a generator of cryptographically strong pseudo-random tokens; will be replaced
   by something more generic soon
** `profile` -- a profiling hack

* *Incompatible:* Several modules now have their own header files:
** `process.h` -- all functions related to processes, previously declared in `lib.h`
** `io.h` -- functions related to files from `lib.h` and `lfs.h`

* `UCW::Configure` supports running of test programs.

* `UCW::CGI` support multiple argument tables and UTF-8 mode. Also, it uses the
  proper HTTP status codes when reporting errors.


4.0 (2009-04-13)
----------------
This was the first stand-alone release of LibUCW. Before that, LibUCW was developed
as a part of the http://www.ucw.cz/holmes/[Sherlock Holmes project].
