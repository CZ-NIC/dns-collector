Mainloop
========

Not every program is sequential. You may need an event driven program
sometime, lets say a railway server. It has a connection to each
station and train to know, where each one is, some things happen at
given times, like train is scheduled to leave as station and so on.

With the mainloop module you can write just the hooks and tell it to
watch over a set of file descriptors, timers and running processes.

// TODO Example?

- <<conventions,Conventions>>
- <<time,Time manipulation>>
- <<file,Activity on file descriptors>>
- <<hooks,Loop hooks>>
- <<process,Child processes>>
- <<control,Control of the mainloop>>
