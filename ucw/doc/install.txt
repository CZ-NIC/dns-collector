Installation of libucw
======================

Prerequisities
--------------
To build and run, you need:

  -  The GNU toolchain (gcc 4.0 or newer is required)
  -  GNU bison and flex
  -  GNU bash 2.0 or newer
  -  Perl (any reasonably new version; 5.6.1 works for me)
  -  ZLib (newer than stone-age)
  -  pkg-config
  -  Linux (porting to other systems should be easy)
  -  GNUPlot 4.0 or newer (if you want to use Watson to draw nice graphs
     with various statistics)
  -  Libjpeg, libpng and libungif to support all image formats
     (jpeg, png and gif). These libraries can be replaced by libgif (gif)
     and GraphicsMagick >= 1.1 (jpeg, png, gif and possible more formats).
     See sherlock/default.cfg for related configuration switches.
  -  Mutt mail client for mail reports in some scripts
     (any reasonably new version; 1.5.9 works)
  -  GNU readline (optional, only non-free version of Sherlock)

Compiling
---------
First of all, you need to run the `configure` script to set up compile-time
options. If you want to compile the library with the default feature set,
just use:

	./configure free

If you need to set anything unusual, please consult <<configure:>> for details.

The defaults determined by the configure script should be correct on Linux/i386,
on other architectures you will probably need to tweak the CPU detection section
in `ucw/autoconf.cfg` and possibly also the typedefs in `ucw/config.h`.

Then run

	make

which builds the whole package in the `run` directory and you can play there.
If you want to install it anywhere else, just use

//TODO Implement the installation

	make install INSTALL_DIR=/where/to/install
