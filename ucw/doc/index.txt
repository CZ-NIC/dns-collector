The UCW library
===============

The UCW library aims to provide a set general purpose tools for programming
in the C language. It contains generic data structures (lists, trees, hash
tables etc.), fast memory allocators optimized for various usage patterns,
abstract I/O streams and optimized implementations of some common algorithms
(e.g., sorting of arrays and files).

Please note that this documentation is not yet complete. Many modules are
not described, so you might need to look into the source code.

You can see the index of <<def_index:,documented definitions>>.
