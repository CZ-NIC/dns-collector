UCW libraries
=============

The UCW libraries aim to provide some general purpose tools for C
programming language. It contains faster implementations of some
algorithms found in libc (for example, sorting), few commonly used not
available in libc (sha1 hash), several generic data structures (hash
tables, binomial heap) and some less common tools (memory pools).

It is probable you may save yourself some time by using this library.

Please note this documentation is not yet complete. There are lot of
modules not yet described, look into the source code.
