/***
 * [[file]]
 * Activity on file descriptors
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * You can ask the main loop to watch a set of file descriptors for activity.
 * (This is a generalization of the select() and poll() system calls. Internally,
 * it uses either poll() or the more efficient epoll().)
 *
 * You create a <<struct_main_file,`struct main_file`>>, fill in a file descriptor
 * and pointers to handler functions to be called when the descriptor becomes
 * ready for reading and/or writing, and call @file_add(). When you need to
 * modify the handlers (e.g., to set them to NULL if you are no longer interested
 * in a given event), you should call @file_chg() to notify the main loop about
 * the changes.
 *
 * From within the handler functions, you are allowed to call @file_chg() and even
 * @file_del().
 *
 * The return value of a handler function should be either <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>
 * or <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>. <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>
 * signals that the function would like to consume more data immediately
 * (i.e., it wants to be called again soon, but the event loop can postpone it after
 * processing other events to avoid starvation). <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>
 * tells that the handler wants to be called when the descriptor becomes ready again.
 *
 * For backward compatibility, 0 can be used instead of <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>
 * and 1 for <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>.
 *
 * If you want to read/write fixed-size blocks of data asynchronously, the
 * <<blockio,Asynchronous block I/O>> interface could be more convenient.

/***
 * [[blockio]]
 * Asynchronous block I/O
 * ----------------------
 *
 * If you are reading or writing fixed-size blocks of data, you can let the
 * block I/O interface handle the boring routine of handling partial reads
 * and writes for you.
 *
 * You just create <<struct_main_block_io,`struct main_block_io`>> and call
 * @block_io_add() on it, which sets up some <<struct_main_file,`main_file`>>s internally.
 * Then you can just call @block_io_read() or @block_io_write() to ask for
 * reading or writing of a given block. When the operation is finished,
 * your handler function is called.
 *
 * Additionally, the block I/O is equipped with a timer, which can be used
 * to detect communication timeouts. The timer is not touched internally
 * (except that it gets added and deleted at the right places), feel free
 * to adjust it from your handler functions by @block_io_set_timeout().
 * When the timer expires, the error handler is automatically called with
 * <<enum_block_io_err_cause,`BIO_ERR_TIMEOUT`>>.
