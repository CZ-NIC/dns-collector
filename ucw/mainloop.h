/***
 * [[file]]
 * Activity on file descriptors
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * You can ask the main loop to watch a set of file descriptors for activity.
 * (This is a generalization of the select() and poll() system calls. Internally,
 * it uses either poll() or the more efficient epoll().)
 *
 * You create a <<struct_main_file,`struct main_file`>>, fill in a file descriptor
 * and pointers to handler functions to be called when the descriptor becomes
 * ready for reading and/or writing, and call @file_add(). When you need to
 * modify the handlers (e.g., to set them to NULL if you are no longer interested
 * in a given event), you should call @file_chg() to notify the main loop about
 * the changes.
 *
 * From within the handler functions, you are allowed to call @file_chg() and even
 * @file_del().
 *
 * The return value of a handler function should be either <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>
 * or <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>. <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>
 * signals that the function would like to consume more data immediately
 * (i.e., it wants to be called again soon, but the event loop can postpone it after
 * processing other events to avoid starvation). <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>
 * tells that the handler wants to be called when the descriptor becomes ready again.
 *
 * For backward compatibility, 0 can be used instead of <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_IDLE`>>
 * and 1 for <<enum_main_hook_return,`HOOK_RETRY`>>.
 *
 * If you want to read/write fixed-size blocks of data asynchronously, the
 * <<blockio,Asynchronous block I/O>> interface could be more convenient.

 * ----------------------
 *
 * If you are reading or writing fixed-size blocks of data, you can let the
 * block I/O interface handle the boring routine of handling partial reads
 * and writes for you.
 *
 * You just create <<struct_main_block_io,`struct main_block_io`>> and call
 * @block_io_add() on it, which sets up some <<struct_main_file,`main_file`>>s internally.
 * Then you can just call @block_io_read() or @block_io_write() to ask for
 * reading or writing of a given block. When the operation is finished,
 * your handler function is called.
 *
 * Additionally, the block I/O is equipped with a timer, which can be used
 * to detect communication timeouts. The timer is not touched internally
 * (except that it gets added and deleted at the right places), feel free
 * to adjust it from your handler functions by @block_io_set_timeout().
 * When the timer expires, the error handler is automatically called with
 * <<enum_block_io_err_cause,`BIO_ERR_TIMEOUT`>>.

/***
 * [[recordio]]
 * Asynchronous record I/O
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Record-based I/O is another front-end to the main loop file operations.
 * Unlike its older cousin `main_block_io`, it is able to process records
 * of variable length.
 *
 * To set it up, you create <<struct_main_rec_io,`struct main_rec_io`>> and call
 * @rec_io_add() on it, which sets up some <<struct_main_file,`main_file`>>s internally.
 *
 * To read data from the file, call @rec_io_start_read() first. Whenever any data
 * arrive from the file, they are appended to an internal buffer and the `read_handler`
 * hook is called. The hook checks if the buffer already contains a complete record.
 * If it is so, it processes the record and returns the number of bytes consumed.
 * Otherwise, it returns 0 to tell the buffering machinery that more data are needed.
 * When the read handler decides to destroy the `main_rec_io`, it must return `~0U`.
 *
 * On the write side, `main_rec_io` maintains a buffer keeping all data that should
 * be written to the file. The @rec_io_write() function appends data to this buffer
 * and it is written on background. A simple flow-control mechanism can be asked
 * for: when more than `write_throttle_read` data are buffered for writing, reading
 * is temporarily suspended.
 *
 * Additionally, the record I/O is equipped with a timer, which can be used
 * to detect communication timeouts. The timer is not touched internally
 * (except that it gets added and deleted at the right places), feel free
 * to adjust it from your handler functions by @rec_io_set_timeout().
 *
 * All important events are passed to the `notify_handler`: errors when
 * reading or writing, timeouts, the write buffer becoming empty, ... See
 * <<enum_rec_io_notify_status,`enum rec_io_notify_status`>> for a complete list.

 * Synchronous delivery of signals

 * the loop (if it is not already awake) and it is processed in the same way
 * as all other events.
 *
 * When used in a multi-threaded program, the signals are delivered to the thread
 * which is currently using the particular main loop context. If the context is not
 * current in any thread, the signals are blocked.
 *
