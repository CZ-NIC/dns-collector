/***
 * === Resource classes
 *
 * A resource class describes how to handle a particular type of resources.
 * Most importantly, it defines a set of (optional) callbacks for performing operations
 * on the resources:
 *
 * * dump() should print a description of the resource used for debugging
 *   to the standard output. The description should end with a newline character
 *   and in case of a multi-line description, the subsequent lines should be
 *   indented by @indent spaces.
 * * free() frees the resource; the struct resource is freed automatically afterwards.
 * * detach() breaks the link between the struct resource and the real resource;
 *   the struct resource is freed automatically afterwards, while the resource
 *   continues to live.
 *
 * The following functions are intended for use by the resource classes only.
