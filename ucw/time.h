/***
 * === Timestamps
 *
 * All timing functions in LibUCW are based on signed 64-bit timestamps
 * with millisecond precision (the <<basics:type_timestamp_t,`timestamp_t`>> type), which measure
 * time from an unspecified moment in the past. Depending on the compile-time
 * settings, that moment can be the traditional UNIX epoch, or for example
 * system boot if POSIX monotonic clock is used.

 * A user type for parsing of time intervals in configuration files.
 * It is specified as fractional seconds and internally converted to
 * a <<basics:type_timestamp_t,`timestamp_t`>>. When conversion of
 * a non-zero value yields zero, an error is raised.

/***
 * === Timers
 *
 * A timer is a very simple construct for measuring execution time.
 * It can be initialized and then read multiple times. Each read returns
 * the number of milliseconds elapsed since the previous read or initialization.
