How to release libucw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Run maint/abi-check-exports. No symbols should be listed except for _init
  and friends. Otherwise, run maint/abi-map-symbols, update maint/libucw.abi
  accordingly, and call maint/abi-rename symbols to fix headers.

- Update version numbers and ABI suffix in ucw/default.cfg:
      - If there were major changes, or changes which are not backward
        compatible on source level, increase the major number.
      - If new features were added, increase the minor number.
      - Otherwise, increase only the third number.
      - If anything in the ABI was changed, update UCW_ABI_SUFFIX.

- git-tag vX.Y.Z

- Run maint/release
