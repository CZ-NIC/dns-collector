  /* In the worst case, the compressed file will not be longer than its

   *
   * The additive constant is for EOF and the header of the file.
   *
   * The multiplicative constant comes from 19-byte incompressible string
   * followed by a 3-sequence that can be compressed into 2-byte link.  This
   * breaks the copy-mode and it needs to be restarted with a new header.  The
   * total length is 2(header) + 2(link) + 19(string) = 23.
