=head1 NAME

Sherlock::Query -- Communication with Sherlock Search Servers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This perl library offers a simple interface for connecting to Sherlock
search servers, sending queries or control commands and parsing the
results.

First of all, you have to use

	my $conn = new Sherlock::Query('server:port');

to create a new connection object (unconnected yet). Then you can call

	my $res = $conn->command('command');

to establish the connection, send a given command to the search server
and gather the results (see below) or, if you want to send a normal query,

	my $res = $conn->query('"simple" OR "query"');

which does the same as C<< $conn->command(...) >>, but it also parses the
results to a representation convenient for handling in Perl programs
(again, see below).

Currently, you can use a single connection to send only a single command or query.

=head1 RESULTS

The I<raw answer> of the search server (i.e., the lines it has returned) is always
available as C<< $conn->{RAW} >> as a list of strings, each representing a single
line.

Parsed results of queries are stored in a more complicated way, but before
explaining it, let's mention a couple of axioms: Any search server I<object>
(header, footer, a single document of answer) is always stored as a hash keyed
by attribute names. Ordinary single-valued attributes are stored as strings,
multi-valued attributes as (references to) arrays of strings. When an object
contains sub-objects, they are stored as references to other hashes, possibly
encapsulated within a list if there can be multiple such objects. Most objects
have an extra attribute C<RAW> containing the original description of the
object, a sub-list of C<< $conn->{RAW} >>.

The parsed answer consists of three parts (please follow F<doc/search> to
get a better picture of what does the server answer): header C<< $conn->{HEADER} >>
(an object, as described above), footer C<< $conn->{FOOTER} >> (object) and document
cards C<< $conn->{CARDS} >> (a list of objects).

The I<header> contains all the standard header attributes and also C<< $hdr->{D} >>
which is a list of sub-objects, each corresponding to a single database and
containing per-database attributes like C<W> (word list).

The I<footer> is pretty straightforward and it just contains what you'd
expect it to.

Each I<card> contains the usual document attributes (see F<doc/objects> for
a list) plus C<< $card->{U} >> which is a list of sub-objects corresponding
to URL's of the document and containing per-URL attributes like C<U> (URL),
C<s> (original size) and C<T> (content type).

When in doubt, call the C<print> method which will print the whole contents
of the connection object. It's actually a much more general (but pretty
simple due to Perl being able to be a very introspective language) routine
usable for dumping any acyclic Perl data structure composed of strings,
hashes, arrays and references to them. You can access this general routine
by calling C<format({ print; }, $what)> which dumps C<$what> and for
each line of output it calls the given subroutine.

=head1 SEE ALSO

A good example of use of this module is the C<query> utility and
of course the example front-end (F<front-end/query.cgi>).
