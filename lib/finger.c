 *  We use a hashing function to map all the URL's and other
 *  hairy strings we work with to a much simpler universe
 *  of constant length bit strings (currently 96-bit ones).
 *  With a random hashing function (which is equivalent to
 *  having a fixed function and random input), the probability
 *  of at least one collision happening is at most c*n^2/m
 *  where n is the number of strings we hash, m is the size
 *  of our bit string universe (2^96) and c is a small constant.
 *  We set m sufficiently large and expect no collisions
 *  to occur. On the other hand, the worst thing which could
 *  be caused by a collision is mixing up two strings or labels
 *  of two documents which is relatively harmless.
