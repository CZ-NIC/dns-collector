This directory contains regular expression routines from the GNU libc 2.3.2
which are significantly faster than the default regex libraries on most systems.

They are distributed under the GNU LGPL.

All files are exact copies of the original distribution, I only provided my
own regex.c, regex-sh.h and Makefile.
