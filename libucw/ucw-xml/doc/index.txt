The UCW-XML library
===================

This library provides a light-weight XML parser built atop <<../ucw/index:,LibUCW>>.
It is primarily intended for efficient parsing of huge data sets, where other
parsers are too slow and cumbersome.

Its features include:

* High speed and low memory consumption, mainly thanks to efficient LibUCW
  primitives like fastbufs and mempools.
* Multiple interfaces:
** SAX-like: callback functions called on various parser events
** Pull: for each call of the parser, it returns the next node
** DOM-like: returns a data structure describing the whole tree of nodes
** Any combination of the above: For example, when given a database with millions
   of records, you can pull on the top level and ask for DOM of each record
   separately.
* Support of namespaces.
* Complies with W3C recommendations on XML 1.0, XML 1.1, and Namespaces in XML 1.0
  as a non-validating parser, but does not aim to support all frills of other
  XML-related standards.
* Partial support for DTD-driven parsing: basic checks of document structure,
  filling in default values, expanding user-defined entities.
