Extended types
==============

Extended types ('xtypes') are user-defined data types equipped with mechanisms
for parsing and printing.

Each xtype is described by a <<struct_xtype,`struct xtype`>>, which contains properties of the type
and several pointers to callback functions.

Xtypes are currently supported by the following modules:

* <<table:,Table printer>>
* <<opt:,Command-line option parser>>
* <<conf:,Configuration parser>>
