Growing arrays
==============

This module provides growing arrays with items of an arbitrary type.
(Alternatively, you might want to use <<mempool:gbuf,growing mempool buffers>>,
or the somewhat obsolete <<growbuf:,growing buffers>>.)

From the user's point of view, the array is represented as a pointer to
its first element, so it can be indexed by the usual `[]` operator. Please
keep in mind that this pointer can change, whenever the array is resized.

Additional book-keeping information is stored before the first element
and it can be accessed using the macros below.
